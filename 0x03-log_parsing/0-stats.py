A  script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics:

Input format: <IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1"
<status code> <file size> (if the format is not this one, the line is skipped)

After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C),
print these statistics from the beginning:

Total file size: File size: <total size>

where <total size> is the sum of all previous <file size>

Number of lines by status code:
possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500
if a status code doesnâ€™t appear or is not an integer,
does not print anything for this status code

format: <status code>: <number>
status codes is printed in ascending order
